For the month of July I intend to do what [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com) in his book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) calls a *digital declutter*. For 31 days I'll abstain from the use of Facebook, Instagram and the like. I just don't like how I behave around these engineered endless sources of dopamin hits. These are my rules:

1. I may check email once a day, using my new favorite, [HEY.com](https://hey.com).
2. I may check the Instagram page of [Gillio](https://www.gillio.be) once on Monday evenings, to know if that particular binder I'm waiting for will be released on the Tuesday after, because if I miss it it might be another decade before I get a new chance.
3. I may check two sources of news once every morning.

Apart from that, no optional technologies.

I plan to put my iPhone in a drawer and only use my [Punkt MP01](https://www.oldways.se/2019/02/03/punkt-mp01) when I'm out and about. We'll se if that's even possible these days.

I'll try to fill the void with good old-fashioned reading and practicing being bored.
