Reddit user *u/obrien654j*:

> "Because the phone has no left/right buttons, you sometimes encounter (android) dialogs that you cannot make a choice on (without the use of a computer and adb to inject keyevents). [...] Standby time is surprisingly bad. emailed punkt about this. they told me that there's a known issue with an app that is not closing properly and they have a fix in the works. [...] The t9 engine appears to be re-ordering words based on usage using an unknown algorithm. [...] Randomly t9 will stop completing the word I'm typing and start a new word."

I think I'll hold on to my MP01 for a while longer.
