**It seems it is time for my annual tradition** of trying to transition from my personal size binder to my lovely [A5 Gillio Compagna](https://www.gillio.be/en/leather-items/planners-covers/organiser-a5-compagna-2) in that lovely older Epoca leather that patinas so much better than current offerings. I have failed this transition ever year so far, due to that A5 binder being so much larger and due to the fact that I have not really found a diary insert that suits my needs (or to be more accurate, wants).

To be honest, I do not really use my diary for much scheduling. My family and my workplace use digital calendars and trying to resist the advantages of accepting that system is futile. I jot down the few important personal dates in my paper diary (always in pencil) and then use the rest of the page as a log for how things went and how I felt about that (always in ink). Therefore, what I need are wide margins, rather than rigid and detailed diary layouts. For this years attempt I tried to design a diary insert just like this. I am only a few days in, but it feels rather good!
