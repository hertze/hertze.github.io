**A few years ago I wrote a [simple Python script](https://github.com/hertze/Alfie)** that lets you make diary inserts meant to be printed, punched and used in your (Filofax-style) binder. I’ve used it ever since on my own computer to make all my dated inserts in various formats and layouts. I always dreamt of making this into a handy web app, but simply never learned enough code to get it done. Now, *Hagen Trinter* made my dream come true and actually built it! Play with the web app [here](https://alfieweb.7c8.de), and—if you feel so inclined—have a look at [the code](https://github.com/htrinter/alfieweb) at GitHub.
