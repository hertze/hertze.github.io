Mystery man *Christoffer* wrote the best guide to Melin's system that I've seen. If you read and write in Swedish and want to learn shorthand I urge you to check it out. Learning this is still on my someday/maybe list (actually I've put it on my active projects list a few times but have always put it back away) and now I know where to go.
